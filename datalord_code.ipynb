       "       \\r\\nAugust Newsletter\\r\\n \\r\\nDear AVians,\\r\\n \\r\\nWe have had one of the most anticipated events of the month - Fireside Chat with DJ Patil, Former Data Scientist of the USA and I am thrilled to congratulate the whole team for putting up an excellent session as well as to those who were present there and made full out of this opportunity. If you've missed it, here's a coverage of the event for you all: Watch here. He's touched upon various important areas which I personally recommend you all should listen to!\\r\\n \\r\\nAnd moving to our biggest event of the year - DataHack Summit 2017. On great demands, we've extended the 'early bird tickets' offer till 7th August. So, make sure you have your booking before it finishes. As we are now finalising the Workshops and sessions of the Summit (Take a look at the sessions here) - if you have a strong command over Analytics/ Data Science specific subjects or if you know someone who does, we humbly invite you to share the dais with other experts and be one of the speakers at the Summit. You can submit your interests here. \\r\\n \\r\\nMeanwhile, upgrade your skills with an excellent Beginner's guide on Tableau, D3.js, Intro. on Genetic Algorithm and many more useful topics been explained through our articles published in July. \\r\\n \\r\\nSo keep up with the pace, keep pouring your suggestions for the event as well as for our daily efforts to ensure we deliver what you are looking for!

       "       \\r\\nOctober Newsletter\\r\\n \\r\\nDear AVians,\\r\\n \\r\\nOur flagship Data Science event - DataHack Summit 2017 is just round the corner. All the hard work put in till now is coming together. DataHack Summit is an unique event focused on practitioners, data science leaders and practical knowledge sharing. \\r\\n \\r\\nWe are thrilled to announce 10 Hack Sessions at the conference. Each Hack Session would be 1 hour session, where live problems will be solved by an expert. The hack sessions are being crafted with the same rigour which we put in our articles and tutorials. Some of the hack sessions include Deploying Machine Learning Models, Sentiment analysis, Automated Machine Learning using MLBox.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have last few tickets for the workshops announced previously. Looking at this awesome response, we are announcing 2 more workshops - Deep Learning using TensorFlow and Natural Language Processing (NLP) from Scratch. Each of these workshops will happen on 11th November 2017 and are 8 hour long.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo provide students a chance to win tickets to DataHack Summit 2017, we have The Ultimate Student Hunt 2017 coming up. Click Prediction Hackathon, is underway, so keep your eyes rolling and brain working!\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are very eager to meet you all at the Summit and making this event reach the potential that our community has to offer!

       "       Dear AVians,\\r\\n \\r\\nWe are shaping up a superb data science ecosystem brick by brick. The community is thriving with events and interactions. I can see a new world where data science knowledge is getting created through our community interactions.\\r\\n \\r\\nOur entire team extremely excited about our first annual conference - DataHack Summit 2017. The conference is shaping up superbly - this would be first of its kind conference with hands-on practitioners sharing their knowledge, challenges and bleeding edge work. A few awesome sessions & workshops have been announced and there are many more to come. Book your early-bird spot before they finish. If you know/are a data science leader and have done really awesome work - reach out to us and we can provide you Indias largest platform for data science practitioners.\\r\\n \\r\\nNow, coming to last month, I am feeling proud to announce that our dedicated volunteers now run meet up programs across 5 cities - check out our upcoming Expert Meet-ups. These meetups are meant for practitioners and are invite-only, hands-on problem-solving sessions.\\r\\n \\r\\nIn addition to this, you might have noticed some top notch articles on deep learning like Introduction to GANs and coding Neural Networks from scratch in R & Python.\\r\\n \\r\\nWe constantly bring various jobs vacancies across India - so to help you with your career beginnings/ change, keep a tab on the latest openings here.\\r\\n \\r\\nSo, see you all very soon in this new world emerging!\\r\\n \\r\\nRegards,\\r\\n \\r\\nKunal Jain  \\\n",

       "       Machine learning algorithms are considered black-box models. However, their outputs are of immense business importance that humans need to understand and act upon. For example, if a clustering model suggests 4 customer clusters, how do we identify and characterize these? If a random forest model suggests a pattern of classification, how do we understand the dominant factors and the irrelevant ones?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nDear Enthusiasts,\\r\\n \\r\\nWe are announcing our new session on \"Visualizing Machine Learning\" at the DataHack Summit 2017 - Conference on Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning.\\r\\n \\r\\nDates:  9-11 November 2017 \\r\\nVenue: MLR Convention Center, Bengaluru\\r\\n \\r\\nAnand S will discuss topics that fall under the umbrella of model visualization  where the inputs, process, and output of machine learning models are the topics of understanding.\\r\\n \\r\\nSpeaker: Anand S is the Founder & CEO of Gramener.
